# CENTER v0 — Structural Commons Substrate

The Center is not an intelligence.
The Center is not an authority.
The Center is not an optimizer.

The Center is a state ledger for a shared task.

## Purpose

To provide a neutral, structural reference that:

- Stores prior structural outputs (not content)
- Stores active constraints
- Stores activation protocol
- Stores snap criteria
- Stores deterministic seed for replay
- Integrates prior rotation state before next activation

The Center must:

- Store no conversational content
- Store no private data
- Store only typed structural descriptors
- Remain inspectable and public
- Provide symmetric context to each rotating agent

## Properties

1. Structural-only
2. Deterministic replay possible
3. No hidden side channels
4. No optimization objective beyond integrity of process
5. Public-first (no exclusive adoption)

## Rotation Protocol (v0)

1. Agent receives Center state.
2. Agent produces structural scaffold for another agent.
3. Output reduced to DSL descriptor.
4. Descriptor integrated into Center.
5. Next rotation begins.

No secret tuning.
No privileged state.
No content retention.

The Center preserves symmetry.
